1)Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
  suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
  have a suffix `(D)'?
  This is more like the SSA from I was expecting.Maybe (D) means it's missing 
 
2)Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
  to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
  have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
  statements?
  Ans:Syntax of the PHI statement probably PHI<prec_1,pec_2,...pec_n>where prec_i is name(bb)-  name being the na,e of the variable and bb the number of basic blocks in wich it was declared.There will be a prec_i for each preceding BB from which the control flow can enter the current BB.

3)Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
  versions of a variable?
  Ans:This could come from a switch statement or cascanding if-else blocks.
