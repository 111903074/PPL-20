1)How is array declaration and initialization handled?
Ans:Array declared in a single statement with no initialisation and explicit size.Initialisation takes place one element per statement on scope entry.

2)Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
  an intermediate temporary?
  Ans:Presumaly because like in many architecture only one memory operation per instruction is permitted.This probably simplifies many things.
  
3)Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
Ans:To mark the arrays as invalid at scope exit-probably to simplify analysis and permit reuse of stack slots,etc.
