1)Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
  the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
  Ans:
  BB3 and 4 corresponds to while loop.BB2 avoids executing an iteration unconditionally by having an unconditional goto to BB4 hich i the while loop conditional.This is different from yhe if-else jumps,which always seen to be unconditional.

2)Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
  able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
  loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
  special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
  Ans:
  BB5:outer loop induction variable initialisation
  BB10:outer loop conditional check
  BB6:Inner loop induction variable initialisation
  BB8:Inner loop conditional check
  BB7:Inner loop body+induction variable increament
  BB6:Outer loop induction variable increament
